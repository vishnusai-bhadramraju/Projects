INSTRUCTIONS

Data Loading And Processing

•	All the data files are uploaded, be mindful while data uploaded wrong files might end up causing errors
•	Ensure tables names 
•	Ensure DATA BASE CONNECTION Parameters 

Business Stakes Questions:

To solve all questions poised in the assessment, require a relationship between all tables, there’s a strong possibility its not possible with the given data.

ORDER OF OPERATION:

•	Please create tables in the POSTGRESQL OR DATABASES before ingestion of data into database. You can just upload and run the SQL CREATE TABLE FILE (Filename: Tables_creation.sql)
•	Alter table commands must be run after tables creation (filename: Alter_table_commands.sql)
•	Please process the Jupyter notebook python file. (Filename: Code.ipynb )


Noticed in the data files, the Json format files contains some extra erroneous spaces in the users and brands, and in Receipts table there was a nested receipts items needed to be mindful while unloading the data.

Due, to continues errors with PostgreSQL needed to adopt some manual work to ensure integrity and error avoidance.
